        <i><b>What is CSS?</b></i>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
            <li><del>Css is not neccesary</del> <b id="nazar1">CSS saves a lot of work.</b>it can control the layout of  multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
            <li><em><ins>External stylesheets are stored in CSS file</ins></em></li>
        </ol>
        <i><b>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</b></i>
        <ul style="letter-spacing: 7px; color: blueviolet; font-size: small; font-weight: bold;">
                  <li>inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elemental</li>
              <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
              <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
              <li> The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<section>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</section>,because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is the CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
